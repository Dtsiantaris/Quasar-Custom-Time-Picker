# Notes
PS1: I have provided just this source code because this component is not very abstract and its use case is specific to the needs of the project I was working on when I created it. 

PS2: The clock icon opens a QTime component in a Dialog.

PS3: CustomButton is just a wrapped QButton component with some extra props.
